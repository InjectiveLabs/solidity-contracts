# ERC20 Single Token Representation on Injective

Injective supports a single-token representation model for ERC-20 tokens using 
the Bank precompile, which connects EVM-based smart contracts to the native 
`x/bank` module. This model eliminates double-accounting and enables seamless 
interoperability between the EVM and the native chain state.

## Overview

The Bank precompile allows Solidity smart contracts to interact directly with 
the native `x/bank` module of the Injective chain. By using this precompile, 
developers can implement ERC-20 tokens that are backed entirely by native chain 
balances, rather than managing a separate balance within the EVM.

Each ERC-20 token using the Bank precompile is represented on-chain with a 
special denom of the form:

```
erc20/<contract-address>
```

For example, a token deployed at 0x123...abc will have a denom of erc20/0x123...abc.

## Key Properties

- Single source of truth: Tokens exist only on-chain via the `x/bank` module. 
The smart contract simply provides a view and interface for the native balances.

- No bridging required: Unlike traditional bridge-based representations, this 
model avoids dual-token setups. There is no need for wrapping/unwrapping or 
deposit/withdraw actions.

- Instant consistency: Any native bank transfer is immediately reflected in the 
ERC-20 view, and any transfer() call in Solidity reflects directly in the chain 
state.

## Benefits

ðŸ”’ Secure â€“ No wrapped tokens or bridging logic; balances are held directly in 
the Injective chain.

ðŸš€ Fast and simple â€“ No sync delays or manual operations to keep two systems in 
balance.

ðŸ§  Developer-friendly â€“ Use familiar ERC-20 interfaces while leveraging native 
chain accounting.

## Available Contracts

Several reusable contracts are available.

| Contract                  | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bank.sol                  | Interface for the Bank precompile                                         |
| BankERC20.sol	            | Abstract ERC-20 implementation backed by the Bank precompile              |
| FixedSupplyBankERC20.sol	| ERC-20 with a fixed supply, fully decentralized (no minting or burning)   |
| MintBurnBankERC20.sol	    | ERC-20 with an owner that can mint and burn tokens                        |

All implementations extend OpenZeppelinâ€™s standard ERC20 interfaces, enabling 
easy integration and extension.

## Customise Your Own ERC-20

Developers are free to implement their own ERC-20 tokens using the Bank 
precompile interface. Start by inheriting from BankERC20.sol, or fork and modify 
existing implementations to suit your requirements.

## Example

For a full example of how to deploy and interact with our `MintBurnBankERC20.sol`
contract, which is banked entirely by x/bank denoms, please refer to the
